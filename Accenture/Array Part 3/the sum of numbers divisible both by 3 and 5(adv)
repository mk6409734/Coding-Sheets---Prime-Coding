You are required to implement the following function: Int Calculate(int m, int n); The function accepts 2 positive integers 'm' and 'n' as its arguments.You are required to calculate the sum of numbers divisible both by 3 and 5, between 'm' and 'n' both inclusive and return the same. Note: Example Input: m: 12 n: 50 Output 90

def Calculate(m, n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(m, n + 1):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            total_sum += i
    return total_sum

# Example usage
m = 12
n = 50
print(Calculate(m, n))  # Output: 90
