You are given a function:lnt MaxExponents (int a , int b);You have to find and return the number between 'a' and 'b' ( range inclusive on both ends) which has the maximum exponent of 2.The algorithm to find the number with maximum exponent of 2 between the given range is Loop between 'a' and Let the looping variable be 'i'. Find the exponent (power) of 2 for each 'i' and store the number with maximum exponent of 2 so far in a variable , let say 'max'. Set 'max' to 'i' only if 'i' has more exponent of 2 than 'max'. Return 'max'. AssumptionNote If two or more numbers in the range have the same exponents of 2 , the small number. Example Input: 7 12 Output: 8 

def max_exponents(a, b):
    def count_exponent_of_2(x):
        exponent = 0
        while x % 2 == 0:
            x //= 2
            exponent += 1
        return exponent
    
    max_exponent = -1
    result = a
    for i in range(a, b + 1):
        current_exponent = count_exponent_of_2(i)
        if current_exponent > max_exponent:
            max_exponent = current_exponent
            result = i
        elif current_exponent == max_exponent:
            if i < result:
                result = i
    return result

# Example usage
a = 7
b = 12
print(max_exponents(a, b))  # Output: 8
